INT. BEDROOM - EVENING

ALAN, 35, Caucasian, dorky, gets dressed. 
He puts on his pants, his shirt, his belt, the usual.
He synchronizes his Casio F-91W watch.
He TAPES a large box cutter to his calf. You know where this is going.
He STRAPS a huge, crude bomb to his chest. Yep.

JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
We need to hurry!

Alan fiddles with the bomb. It's a little tight.

ALAN
(to himself)
Damn things are made for kids.

Alan makes the bomb fit. He throws on a hoodie and collects himself.
JOSEPHINE, 33, stunning, of Arabic descent, enters, wearing a trench coat and black beanie.

JOSEPHINE
You feel ready?

ALAN
Yeah. Fine.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Josephine drives. Alan looks uncomfortable in the passenger seat.

JOSEPHINE
It's going to be big. They'll appreciate the effort.

ALAN
(visibly nervous)
I just hope it works, I didn't have much time to plan.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Alan and Josephine pull into a driveway. Alan gets out of the car, and looks around, uncomfortable. Josephine walks ahead of him.

JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
Come on. 

Alan hustles to follow Josephine as an UNMARKED WHITE VAN ROLLS into the driveway unnoticed.

INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - NIGHT

CLAY, 32, MARY 37, and HELEN, 24, NSA agents, stare at a bank of monitors ...
... that shows surveillance video of Alan and Josephine.

CLAY
Are you sure?

MARY
It doesn't matter. You have to. 

HELEN
I don't understand.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

A second UNMARKED VAN PULLS into the driveway. HERCULES TEAM operatives FILE out of the van, decked out in bulletproof vests and helmets, toting SMGs. 
More vans show up. They're all full of operatives.
Even more vans pull up. The vans run out of space in the driveway and use street parking. Some park in neighboring driveways.
Literally dozens of operatives exit the vans and SPRINT off into the night.

INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

A HALLOWEEN PARTY is in full swing. Witches, clowns, zombies, farm animals, and their sexy counterparts chat, drink, flirt, what have you.
Alan and Josephine enter. Alan throws off his hoodie, revealing a stereotypical Arab suicide bomber costume, from turban to sandals to the bomb strapped to his chest. He smiles and presses a red button.

INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - NIGHT

Mary, Clay, and Helen lean forward toward the monitor.

HERCULES TEAM LEADER
Go go go!

INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

The lights on the "bomb" flash and hidden speakers PLAY a MIDI version of "Gangnam Style."
Josephine drops her trenchcoat to reveal that she is dressed as the recently crowned Indian-American Miss America Nina Davuluri (yes, network executives, swimsuit contest version).

JOSEPHINE AND ALAN
(sung) OPPAN HALLOWEEN STY --

Before they can finish the line, half a dozen of the Hercules Team operatives STORM IN and TACKLE Alan and Josephine to the ground. 
MORE OPERATIVES fly in, SWAT style, through the window via rope. 
EVEN MORE OPERATIVES RUSH through the back door, PULVERIZING tchotchkes and sending guests SCATTERING as they roll in. 
Some guests are already crying.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY

CLAY, HELEN, and MARY exit the van and survey the scene. They are careful, as always, to keep themselves well out of harm's way.
COSTUMED GUESTS FLEE the house.
Clay notices a BLEEDING MAN, who sprints from the house SHRIEKING.

CLAY
I didn't hear any shots fired.

HELEN
That's a zombie costume. My roommate's boyfriend has the same one. It looks cuter on him though.

A few Hercules Team members restrain Alan, who now has a black bag over his head, as they haul him to the van.
They THROW Alan into Clay, Helen, and Mary's van.

CLAY
(incensed)
That's not right!

The Hercules Team members turn to Clay.

CLAY (CONT'D)
That's our van.

HERCULES TEAM MEMBER #1
Sorry, sir.

HERCULES TEAM MEMBER #2
Sorry, sir.

HERCULES TEAM MEMBER #3
Sorry, sir.

The Hercules Team Members grab Alan from the van and haul him back to their van. They THROW him in just as aggressively as they did before.
Josephine RUNS OUTSIDE, which is tough to do in beauty pageant high heels. 

JOSEPHINE
Alan! Alan! Oh God! Alan!

Josephine RUNS off into the night, confused and terrified. 

HELEN
Did we just send Hercules Team after a man wearing a fake bomb at a Halloween party?

MARY
That is an accurate assessment of the situation that shouldn't have been spoken aloud.

HELEN
That man is clearly not a terrorist.

A smattering of party guests are still fleeing from the home.

CLAY
Even though the NSA protects our nation, it's still a government organization. 

MARY
Numbers. Quotas. Metrics.

HELEN
Metrics?

MARY
(to Helen)
After some light interrogation, we let him go. Clay hits his numbers. Everybody wins.

CLAY
You'll get used to it. Almost everyone we detain turns out not to be a terrorist.

The Hercules Team's Van PEELS OFF, knocking over the mailbox, destroying a flower bed, and gently brushing into the NSA agents' van as they go.

MARY
(shouting after them)
That scratch is coming out of your department's budget!

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Alan, tired and scared, sits handcuffed to a stainless steel table. Clay and Mary, relaxed on the other side of the table, ask him questions. Helen, studious in the corner of the room, watches and takes diligent notes.

CLAY
This is so easy, Alan. We want to let you go, all you have to do is explain why you're not a terrorist.

ALAN
I know this looks bad. I looked up how to make a bomb, and how to hide a bomb under my clothes, and I even looked up average daily attendance rates of local landmarks so I could talk about that and have it seem realistic at the party-

MARY
Alan, you have to stop talking right now.

ALAN
I'm not a terrorist. I just ...

CLAY
... really really seem like one when you talk.

MARY
We're going to take a minute. When we come back, you need to not sound like a terrorist.

Clay and Mary exit. Helen continues writing feverishly.

ALAN
(to Helen)
What are you writing?

Helen writes "The room falls silent." on her notepad.

OUTSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mary sits at a computer terminal and browses Alan's entire online life. She absentmindedly looks at Alan's bank account.
Bold text is to be deleted when this is updated to indicate they're going to deliberately lead the witness.

CLAY
He's not making this easy for us.

Mary scrolls through Alan's pathetic Facebook pictures: the time he won an eating contest, the time he visited his old college buddies, the time he saw a live taping of "The View" etc.

MARY
He'll crack soon. He'll give us some legitimate excuse we can cross check and he'll be out of here in no time.

Clay sips his coffee.

CLAY
I'm worried about that, I think he's too nervous to give us the right answers.

MARY
Almost like he's a normal person, and not a terrorist who's been trained to stand up under interrogation.

CLAY
I'm not going to be the one to write "too nervous to be a terrorist" on a discharge report.

Clay looks at the terminal, "www.fantasyfootballinsider.com" is listed in his visited websites.

CLAY (CONT'D)
We should be able to clear him just because he plays fantasy football. No way a terrorist has time to play that.

MARY
Think, Clay. If you can't get the suspect to say what you need ...

CLAY
... then lead them.

MARY
Now let's get in there and ask some softball yes or no questions.

They head back into the interrogation room.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

Helen is still scribbling. Her writing is driving Alan nuts.
Clay sits and Mary seizes the opportunity.

MARY
Alan. Are you ready for us to help you?

ALAN
Help me? You're holding me against my will. If anything, you're making me sympathize with-

MARY
Shh. shh. Shut your mouth.

CLAY
Look, we want to help you. Just answer our questions with either yes or no. Do you understand?

ALAN
Yes.

CLAY
Good. Do you enjoy breaking the law, Alan?

ALAN
No.

Clay and Mary nod to each other.

CLAY
Are you currently planning any activities with explosives?

Alan looks at Mary. She arches an eyebrow.

ALAN
No.

MARY
That's a relief. You're building a good case for yourself.

CLAY
Last question. This one is tricky. Are you interested in the violent overthrow of the American government? Yes, somewhat, indifferent, not really, or definitely not?

ALAN
Definitely not.

Mary claps sarcastically.

MARY
Alright, Alan. Good answers.

CLAY
Do you play fantasy football?

ALAN
Huh?

CLAY
Fantasy football. Do you play?

ALAN
Oh. I'm in a league at work.

CLAY
Tavon Austin or D'Angelo Williams as your flex?

ALAN
Ouch.

CLAY
It's been a tough season.

ALAN
Williams. Austin just isn't ready.

CLAY
Right?

MARY
Helen stop writing for a second.

Helen finishes her sentence and puts her pencil down

MARY (CONT'D)
Did you just write "stop writing?"

Helen checks her notebook then nods.

Mary shakes her head, disappointed.

MARY (CONT'D)
Look, we know you're not a terrorist. We just have to keep you here for a few hours, then we can let you go. 

CLAY
We'd love to let you go sooner, but we've got a shitload of paperwork to do setting up the Miami raid on that recently activated sleeper cell.

Mary snaps her head towards Clay.

MARY
Goddamn it, Clay.

INT. TEAM OFFICE - DAY

Helen TYPES on her computer while drinking coffee. A BUZZING SOUND distracts her.
Helen turns around, sees nothing. Back to work. Helen TYPES away. The BUZZING SOUND persists.
Helen stops again. She swivels around in her chair. Nothing there. 
Helen believes she might find an unauthorized spy device from a foreign country, and is momentarily excited to be a hero.
Helen pokes around the office, seeking out the source of the sound. She checks under computer towers and behind monitors, listening for the source. Where is it coming from?
Clay enters, coffee in hand.
Clay smiles and gives Helen an affectionate cuff on the shoulder.

CLAY
Oh. I see you got your drone. Congrats.

HELEN
My --

Clay points above Helen's head. She looks up. 
Sure enough, a small FLOATING DRONE hovers above her head.

HELEN (CONT'D)
What? Why?

CLAY
Interns and new hires are drone monitored at all times. Didn't you read your New Hire paperwork before you signed it?

HELEN
That's pretty intrusive, isn't it?

CLAY
I guess. There's cameras everywhere here anyway. Besides, they can be pretty helpful.

Clay looks up at the Drone admiringly.

CLAY (CONT'D)
Let's get a picture of you two!

Clay takes a 0.8 100-400mm lens off the nearest camera body and swaps in a 1.4 50mm lens. He snaps a few pictures of Helen and Drone.

CLAY (CONT'D)
These drones are classified, so I have to turn these pictures in to the records department. But if you put in a FOIA request now, you should get a copy of them before you retire. I've already got a scrapbook set up once I get back the Polaroids of me and Rusty from back in the day.

Clay walks away, lost in reminiscence. 

HELEN
(calling after Clay) You named your drone?!

Helen looks at Drone.

HELEN (CONT'D)
I'm not naming you.

INT. SPY ROOM - DAY

Clay and Mary sit in a room that puts NASA's command center to shame. They wear headsets, listening intently.

MALE (O.S.)
It was an accident.

WOMAN (O.S.)
What? You just fell into her naked?

MALE (O.S.)
Basically, yes.

WOMAN (O.S.)
What does that even mean?

MARY
It's always trouble in paradise. 

CLAY
Poor guy. He just wants to have sex with as many women as possible. American dream. How's your paradise, Mary?

MARY
Oh, the usual. I'm trying online dating now. 

CLAY
On the internet? Like on OKCupid?

MARY
Yes, literally OKCupid. I missed the first two dates because I worked late and the latest guy referred to me as "frigid" before entrees were served. Every guy's fantasy. They can't get enough.

MALE (O.S.)
(softly, in the background)
I was helping her frame a photo and I fell. You know I'm clumsy.

CLAY
I take it you stopped seeing Adam?

MARY
I'm not even tapping his phone anymore.

CLAY
Cold Turkey. Nice.

MARY
I haven't heard any great stories from you in a while. Still doing singles night at Untrained Melody?

FEMALE (O.S.)
(softly, in the background)
How did you end up with your clothes off?

Clay shifts uncomfortably.

CLAY
No, I haven't been to karaoke in a while. I ... met someone. 

MARY
Spill it. It's got to be more engaging than (gesturing to headset) our accident prone friend.

MALE (O.S.)
(softly, in the background)
She used her shirt to bandage my bruise. I don't need the third degree from you.

CLAY
I don't know. We have so much in common, but I hear everything she says, but she doesn't hear me.

MARY
I heard that. I know it's early on, but have you thought about counseling?

CLAY
I don't think we know each other well enough yet.

MALE (O.S.)
(softly, in the background)
And I had to take my clothes off to see if I had any more bruises. What's so weird about that, Trish?!

MARY
If you don't know her that well, then why are you --

CLARY
I know her better than she knows me.

Clay stops short.

CLAY
Nevermind. Forget it.

FEMALE (O.S.)
(softly, in the background)
I'm sorry. I love you baby.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Helen and her Drone drift down the hallway. 
Helen stops short, hoping the Drone passes her by. No luck.
She zig-zags, walking in unpredictable lines, stopping and starting suddenly. Nothing fools the drone.
Justin watches her fail to outsmart her drone. He and his drone point and laugh.
She stops outside the women's restroom. The drone stops too. She turns to it, glaring.

HELEN
Do. Not.

She enters the bathroom. The Drone remains outside.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

HELEN
Finally, a bit of privacy.

JUSTIN (O.S.)
Hey Helen, are you in the bathroom?

Helen freezes in place.

JUSTIN (CONT'D)
Because your drone's out here. And your drone can follow you everywhere except for the bathroom.

Helen looks for a way to escape. But this is an NSA secure facility, you can't escape from the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

JUSTIN
I mean, I'm not a genius, but it seems like the only reasonable explanation is that you're in the bathroom. Also, I am a genius.

HELEN (O.S.)
Go away, Justin!

JUSTIN
(to Drone)
See you later, too bad you're stuck with the shitty intern.

Drone's lenses audibly focus on Justin.
Justin exits.

Helen emerges from the bathroom, upset.

HELEN
Let's go.

Helen exits. Drone yaws around to follow her.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM HALLWAY - EVENING

Mary, Clay, Helen, and Alan wait outside a conference room. We heard muffled CONVERSATION from inside the conference room. Alan is in an undignified amount of straps.

CLAY
Brady's done. I don't care what you say.

ALAN
We're talking about this now? Brady doesn't have the weapons to-

MARY
Prep him Clay. They'll eat him alive in there.

CLAY
It'll be fine. Just don't say anything.

Alan looks worried. Mary stares at Alan.

MARY
Remember Alan, don't say anything, and don't hear any classified information from Clay.

ALAN
But it's impossible for me to-

MARY
Yes, I get it. It's impossible to not hear something. Everything's unfair. Nothing's my fault.

The conference room door SWINGS OPEN. JUSTIN, 24, an intern beckons them in.

JUSTIN
Right this way.

Mary, Clay, and Alan file into the room. Helen approaches.

JUSTIN (CONT'D)
Authorized personnel only. Your clearance is only Level 4, right?

HELEN
Shut up Justin.

Helen elbows past Justin and into the room. 

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mary, Clay, Alan, and Justin sit as the section heads finish up a conversation.

SECTION HEAD 1
We all have quotas to meet. If you step up your infiltration, we can step up our captures. It's win-win.

SECTION HEAD 2
I'm not seeing how risking more of our agents so yours don't have to work hard is a win-win.

SECTION HEAD 1
Let's circle back to this later.

Section Head 1 and Section Head 2 turn toward the group.

SECTION HEAD 1 (CONT'D)
Thank you for joining us.

SECTION HEAD 2
Let's get down to brass tacks. If you were able to determine so quickly that this man was a worthless asset, why did you capture him in the first place?

CLAY
Umm, due diligence, sir.

MARY
My colleague was being thorough. Unfortunately an innocent man is now being indefinitely detained as a result of that thoroughness.

SECTION HEAD 2
What we'd like to know is how he came to possess classified information. We've seen no records of your interrogation.

Helen looks like she's about to speak. Mary and Clay glare at her. She clams up.

MARY
The ... reports were incomplete.

SECTION HEAD 2
Let's cut the pencil-pusher bullshit. We've reviewed your partial case file and see no need to detain him. 

SECTION HEAD 1
Mind you, this was an egregious oversight on the part of your department, but we've been getting six of these a month with the new system.

SECTION HEAD 2
Cost of doing business. He can go after the Miami raid's done. Should be less than a week. We'll clear a path with the higher-ups.

Alan relaxes.

SECTION HEAD 1
After all, it's not like he knows about the puppet government in Aleppo.

Everyone stares at Section Head 1. Alan knows what's coming. He buries his head in his hands.

SECTION HEAD 1 (CONT'D)
Whoopsie.

INT. NSA OFFICES, CONTINUOUS - EVENING

Mary is staring at a computer screen. At the top of the screen we see: ADAM LEVINSON. Yes, ex-boyfriend Adam. She hasn't stopped spying on him after all. He sits on a couch with an ATTRACTIVE DATE. Attractive date holds a mug in her hand.

ATTRACTIVE DATE
(reading a mug)
"So Say We All?" Is that like a religious phrase or something? 

ADAM
It's from a TV show.

MARY
She hasn't even seen Battlestar Galactica! You're too good for her!

Mary's phone BEEPS. 7:45. Way past quitting time. Her alarm message is, "Please don't be spying on Adam."

MARY (CONT'D)
I gotta stop doing this.

She gives one more stink eye to Adam's date, before shutting off her computer and gathering her things and heading out. 

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Mary passes a door left ajar. A glowing light spills through the crack in the door. Someone's in there. She peeks in. 
It's Clay.
Clay types on his computer. The screen reads: "You are not assigned to this case. Proceed?" 
He proceeds.
A live video stream of a stunning COLOMBIAN WOMAN tending her garden appears on his screen. Clay smiles, melancholy. He relaxes into his seat.
Mary backs away from the door slowly and leaves. 
As she exits, Mary passes ANOTHER DRONE and an ANALYST.

ANALYST
For me?

Analyst grabs a paper from the Drone's clutches.
The Analyst skims the paper. It's a pink slip.

ANALYST (CONT'D)
Damn it. I knew I should have fudged the numbers to make quota.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Helen walks down the hallway followed by the Drone. Every so often, she stops and looks back at the Drone, obviously still uncomfortable.
Helen reaches a locked door with a slot for card swipe and a number pad. She fishes in her pocket. She checks her other pockets. Nothing.

HELEN
Shit.

Helen looks at the number pad. She thinks for a minute. She ENTERS A CODE on the pad.
WRONG CODE. BUZZERS. FLASHING RED LIGHTS. SIRENS.
The Drone SWOOPS in and interfaces with the security panel. 
The BUZZERS, LIGHTS, and SIRENS stop.
Helen looks at The Drone. 

HELEN (CONT'D)
(begrudging)
Thanks. 

Helen stares at The Drone.

HELEN (CONT'D)
After you. 

Helen gestures for The Drone to enter ahead of her.
The Drone ignores her gesture.

HELEN (CONT'D)
No. I didn't expect you to fall for it.

Helen passes through the door and The Drone follows into-

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

The NSA staff eat at your standard work place cafeteria, except that instead of lunch ladies, you have a series of DRONES.
Helen joins Mary and Clay in the lunch line. She looks a bit morose.

CLAY
How ya doing, kid?

HELEN
I'm fine. I umm --

She looks back at her Drone, who hovers dutifully above her.

HELEN (CONT'D)
I can't stop thinking about that couple we heard on the phone. 

MARY
They weren't that bad. A day without domestic abuse is a great day.

CLAY
They'll be fine. He'll get caught again. He'll apologize. She'll take him back. The beat goes on.

HELEN
If my boyfriend treated me like that --

CLAY
You have a boyfriend?

MARY
(under breath)
Of course she does.

HELEN
Ex-boyfriend. He moved to New York after school and I didn't want to do the distance thing.

CLAY
Good move. I'm kind of in one of those now. It's tough.

Mary raises a suspicious eyebrow.
A drone lunch worker SLOPS potato salad onto Helen's plate.

INT. SPY ROOM - EVENING

The trio paces, strategizing. Alan is locked in a cell in the corner.

CLAY
We could fake his death. 

HELEN
We can do that?!

MARY
Don't encourage him, Helen.

ALAN
That seems a bit extreme.

CLAY
Haven't you ever wished you could just leave it all behind?

ALAN
Not permanently.

MARY
We're not faking Alan's death. The ACLU--

HELEN
--The American Civil Liberties Union!

Mary glares at Helen.

MARY
Yes. The ACLU has a long-standing relationship with the NSA.

CLAY
The National Security Agency!

Mary Liz Lemons.

ALAN
You work together?

CLAY
Like the Giants and the Patriots work together.

MARY
They have some pull that we don't. They can help expedite your release by going over the heads of our heads.

CLAY
And if they send Gary, you can talk his ear off about fantasy football, pal.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - EVENING

GARY, a lawyer from the ACLU, speaks with Alan. Alan looks dejected.

GARY
You are a priority Alan, just not our highest priority. At the ACLU, we've got guidelines and metrics just like everybody else.

ALAN
Metrics?

GARY
Our top priorities: keeping America free, preventing unreasonable punishments or detainments, anti-discrimination, and Internet rights.

ALAN
I fit two of those!

GARY
You do. That's why I'm even in the room with you. You see Aaron-

ALAN
Alan.

GARY
My bad. We have so many cases right now that the higher-ups are really pushing us to pick up cases that hit on three or more. It's hard quantifying injustice, but that doesn't mean we can't try.

ALAN
There are that many?

GARY
We've currently got approximately (does some mental math) fifty-seven cases that fit the bill. Just because Gitmo is closing doesn't mean all the cases are, am I right?

ALAN
When can you get to me?

GARY
Hard to say Elian. Based on what you've told me, your best bet is to just stop hearing things. By the time we circle back around to you, all of that confidential info you picked up will be fodder for the Freedom of Information Act.

Alan slumps in his chair as the lawyer packs up.

GARY (CONT'D)
Hell, with Wikileaks, you could be out of here in a week.

Alan remains motionless. Gary grabs his briefcase and heads to the exit.

GARY (CONT'D)
Clay, I'll see you in a couple days for the fantasy draft. Alvin, we still need a twelfth. You in?

ALAN
Sure.

GARY
Don't have much else to do, huh chief?

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - EVENING

Mary logs onto her computer and navigates to Clay's work records. One name appears over and over on his surveillance logs: LAURA MENDOZA.
Mary pulls up Laura's profile.
Yup, the same woman who Mary saw Clay profiling the other night.
A few KEY PHRASES pop out of her profile: LOW-LEVEL AL-QAEDA OPERATIVE, STATUS: INACTIVE QUESTIONED AT NSA HEADQUARTERS: 11/2012, AMATEUR LINGERIE MODEL.

MARY
An amateur model's just a hot cocktail waitress.

Mary continues scrolling through Laura's profile. She pulls up some old surveillance photos that make Laura look pretty good. 

MARY (CONT'D)
(sighs)
Okay, she's stacked. She could be like a Kohl's model or something.

Mary continues scrolling through Laura's profile. Her phone BUZZES. Once again, 7:45.

MARY (CONT'D)
I need a hobby.

INT. BREAK ROOM - DAY

Drone and Helen walk into the break room.

HELEN
Hey, everyone's got to recharge their battery at some point. Three days is a long time. They say my iPad is supposed to last ten hours, but I swear it's like five, max.

Her Drone seems to nod in agreement. Her Drone replaces its own batteries with brutal efficiency. 
Her Drone seems to notice something. Drone BUZZES away to --
-- the coffee maker. The Drone gets to the coffee maker just ahead of Justin and POURS the last cup of coffee into a mug.
Drone BUZZES back to Helen with the mug.

HELEN (CONT'D)
Thanks, Drone. Good thing you changed your batteries. I saw a real speed burst there.

Helen takes a SIP of coffee and loves it.
Justin stares at the empty coffee pot, pretty pissed.

HELEN (CONT'D)
Sorry Justin, you didn't have the correct security clearance for that last cup.

Helen goes to high five the Drone, which ends awkwardly because the Drone doesn't have hands, duh. They stroll down the hall together, just a girl and her Drone. The sun sets. Yes, inside the building.

INT. MEN'S BATHROOM - DAY

Alan sits in a bathroom stall, pants still on. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Mary in the next stall. Clay guards the door.

ALAN
Why are we meeting in here?

MARY
You're a security threat now, Alan. People might want to listen.

ALAN
I'm a what?

MARY
We don't have much time. This is the hail Mary. We've got a meeting with your Congressman this afternoon. If anyone can get you out of here, it's him.

ALAN
Okay.

CLAY
Whatever you do, just don't hear any more privileged information.

ALAN
I'm not sure how I can --

CLAY
Alan, don't fight us on this, we're trying to help you.

ALAN
Sorry.

MARY
Alan, people want you dead.

ALAN
What?!

CLAY
They don't, but they could if you hear the wrong thing.

MARY
You get us?

ALAN
I get you.

INT. SPY ROOM - DAY

Mary and Clay be spyin' again.

WOMAN (O.S.)
How could you?

MAN (O.S.)
She was naked. If I hadn't kept her warm, she could have caught hypothermia.

MARY
Clay. Let's talk.

CLAY
(listening intently to the surveillence)
Just a minute. I want to see how this one plays out. He's so slick.

MARY
I know you've been spying on Laura Mendoza. She's not within our jurisdiction.

Clay's face turns white.

CLAY
We do it all the time. Elected officials, football locker rooms, Ex-boyfriends --

Mary isn't swayed by this.

MARY
She's a terrorist Clay. You've fallen in love with a known terrorist you've never even talked to.

CLAY
We talked. 

Mary glares at Clay.

CLAY (CONT'D)
It was in an interrogation setting, but we talked ... I heard her talk to agents. Look, I haven't seen her in person except for that once, I swear.

MARY
Don't make me launch an investigation, Clay. We work ... reasonably well together.

CLAY
Look, there was no impropriety. I mean, I'm in love with her, but I've never met her.

MARY
What?

CLAY
I'll never make contact with her, I swear. It's just nice to imagine being married to her. Raising some kids. Boy and a girl, maybe.

MARY
Stop, stop right now. If you say another stupid thing I'm going to have to turn you in.

CLAY
You yourself were complaining the other day about how difficult it is to have a relationship with this job. She's all I can -- could handle.

MARY
I get it. You think I don't get lonely? But, you've got to drop it, okay?

Clay nods.

MARY (CONT'D)
You could always try online dating?

CLAY
Right. And have everyone here know my date within seconds of it happening.
INSERT REFERENCE TO MARY ONLINE DATING AND HOW CLAY LIKELY SPIES ON HER.

MARY
Touche.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The trio, Alan, and CONGRESSMAN KANE sit around the conference table.

CONGRESSMAN KANE
Alan, after hearing all the evidence for this case, and knowing that you voted for me
(pauses for laughter, gets none)
Heh. I want to get you out of here as quickly as I can. 

ALAN
I can't thank you enough. It's a huge relief. I'm sure my fiance is worried sick about me.

They shake hands.

CLAY
Alan, I guess this is goodbye. It's been a pleasure.

ALAN
You too. May your starting quarterback always be injured.

They laugh.

MARY
Sorry for all the misunderstanding. I look forward to looking at your emails again instead of your face.

Helen steps forward, handing Alan one of the papers she's been so busy marking. It's a great sketch of Alan, smiling, behind bars.

ALAN
That's what you've been doing.

HELEN
And taking laser specific notes, yes.

Congressman Kane's phone rings.

CONGRESSMAN KANE
I apologize but I need to take this.
(answering)
Hello? ... Yes, of course ... Yes, I'm approving that ... no, just the radioactive stockpiles ... no, they're for bait! If you try to dispose of the waste properly, the entire project is ruined! ... IF YOU DON'T WANT TO CATCH THE LARGEST WEAPONS RING IN THE WORD, BE MY GUEST. JUST LEAVE THE FUCKING WEAPONS-GRADE PLUTONIUM AT THE SITE FOR THEM TO SEE.

Congressman Kane angrily hangs up. The room is stunned.
Mary and Clay look worried.

CONGRESSMAN KANE (CONT'D)
I'm sorry about that folks. Alan, I'll see you on the other side in a few days time.

Kane exits. The room doesn't know how to react. There is silence for a beat.
Kane sheepishly sticks his head back in the room.

CONGRESSMAN KANE (CONT'D)
Come to think of it Alan, you probably shouldn't have heard that whole thing about the first stages of a year-long sting. Might be best if you kept your head down for a little while longer.

Alan's face falls.
Kane puts on his "connecting with voters" face.

CONGRESSMAN KANE (CONT'D)
Alan, my heart breaks for you.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - EVENING

Mary, Clay, and Helen are joined by every NSA person who has dealt with Alan's case so far. Unfortunately for Alan, they're here for a fantasy football draft.
Everyone but Mary clumps at one end of the table, working off of their laptops. Mary sits at the other end finishing up some work.
Alan, via teleconference feed on a laptop is on the clock.

ALAN
I'll take Alshon Jeffrey.

SECTION HEAD 2
Nice pick, Alan. Drop a player for the kicker once you get the lay of the land. This guy's a pro.

ALAN
Thank you. This would be a lot easier if I could be in the room with all of you.

CLAY
Alan, come on. If you're out of the clubhouse-

ALAN
Holding cell.

CLAY
Exactly. If you're out, then I'm on the clock. If I'm on the clock I can't play fantasy football.

ALAN
Well, I wouldn't want to inconvenience you.

SECTION HEAD 1
Don't be selfish, Al. Let's just have fun now.

CLAY
You know what, that was the last pick and it's getting pretty late. Want to head out and wrap up trades tomorrow?

ALAN
Is everyone leaving?

Section Head 2 mutes the teleconference section.

SECTION HEAD 1
Thanks, he was really bringing down the room.

Their mic isn't muted, so Alan can be seen reacting to that.

The visitors stand up and work their way to the exit.

The group files out. Mary, Clay, and Helen exit. 

INT. DETENTION ROOM - NIGHT

Mary, Clay, and Helen enter the detention room with Alan.

MARY
Good night, Alan. We'll see you tomorrow.

CLAY
Check you later, whiz kid.

Helen stares at Alan.

ALAN
Can I call and tell someone where I am?

MARY
No.

ALAN
Oh.

Mary, Clay, and Helen exit.
The light TURNS OFF. Alan is cast into darkness.

HELEN (O.S.)
Oh, wait!

Helen re-enters and turns the light back on. We see a glimmer of hope in Alan's eyes.

HELEN (CONT'D)
Goodnight, Scout. Don't tell anyone I named you.

Helen exits for good this time. She leaves Alan in darkness.
A SOFT SOB in a darkened room.

FADE OUT.

TAG.

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - EVENING

Once again, Mary stares at her computer screen. 
It's Adam and ANOTHER DATE, but we're just watching Mary's reaction.

ANOTHER DATE (O.S.)
Oh, a Battlestar Galactica mug? I love it. Do you want to check if I'm a Cylon? If my back starts glowing, it means you're doing it right.

KISSING SOUNDS. 

Mary turns off her computer. 

MARY
I really have to stop doing this.

Mary's phone alarm goes off again, it's 7:45.
